# PDF_to_Audiobook_App
This is a compact app to take any pdf and turn it into an Mp3 format. The app uses your computers built in speech to text to read out the words in the pdf and converts to MP3.
A future upgrade would be to move away from text to speech on the computer and use more sophisticated AI language processing models to achieve the same result
