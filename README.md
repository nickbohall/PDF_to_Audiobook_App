# PDF_to_Audiobook_App
This is a compact app to take any pdf and turn it into an Mp3 format. The app uses your computers built in speech to text to read out the words in the pdf and converts to MP3.
# How to use
1. Simply open the app in your local machine. 
2. Save the PDF you're trying to convert in the "pdfs" folder
3. Run the app and select the pdf you want to convert
4. The new MP3 will automatically be saved in the "Mp3s" folder 
# Future Upgrade
A future upgrade would be to move away from text to speech on the computer and use more sophisticated AI language processing models to achieve the same result
# Enjoy!
